#  How will the photographers be selected for the project?

The selection of photographers for the project will be done through a call for entries. The photographers will be judged based on their portfolios, and the best ones will be selected to participate in the project.

#  What will the budget be for the project?

The budget is the total estimated cost of a project. It is often expressed in terms of the cost of labor, materials, and equipment. The budget is also used to track actual expenses incurred during the course of the project.

There are a number of different factors that need to be considered when creating a budget for a project. The most important factors are:

-The scope of the project
-The level of detail required
-The amount of time available for the project
-Any special requirements or constraints

After considering these factors, you can begin to estimate the cost of each element of the project. This will help you create a detailed budget that is realistic and achievable.

#  How long will the project last?

The duration of the project is an important factor that has to be considered while planning and budgeting. You need to know how much work needs to be done and how long it is likely to take in order to schedule the project effectively.

There are several factors that will determine how long the project will last:

The size and complexity of the project - a more complex project will take longer to complete than a simpler one
The number of people working on the project - larger projects with more people involved will take longer than smaller projects with fewer people involved
The availability of resources - if resources are not readily available, it may slow down the progress of the project
External dependencies - if there are any external dependencies, such as waiting for approvals or supplies from other organisations, this will also add time to the project
The level of expertise of those carrying out the work - a team with less experience may take longer than a team with more experience to complete the same task

 So how can you estimate how long your project is going to last? There is no foolproof method, but here are some guidelines that you can use: 

 1. break the project into stages and estimate how long each stage is likely to take 

 2. use historical data or past experiences as a guide 

 3. consider what might delay or interrupt the work 
 4. factor in contingency time for unexpected delays 

 Let's look at each of these in more detail: 

 1. break the project into stages and estimate how long each stage is likely to take 
This is probably the most accurate way to estimate duration, as it takes into account all of the factors that could affect it. By breaking down the project into stages, you can estimate how much time each one will take and then add them up to get an overall estimate. This approach also helps you identify any potential delays or problems early on so that you can plan for them. 
2. use historical data or past experiences as a guide 
If you have previous experience with a similar type of project, this can be used as a guide for estimating duration. However, bear in mind that every project is unique and Past experiences may not always reflect what could happen on this particular project . Additionally, historical data can be skewed if there are any major changes in requirements or if new technology is introduced. 
3. consider what might delay or interrupt the work 
There are many things that could delay or interrupt work on a project – materials not arriving on time, someone being unavailable due to illness, political unrest preventing people from travelling etc. It's important to factor these potential disruptions into your estimate so that you're not caught off guard later on. 
4. factor in contingency time for unexpected delays 
Unexpected delays can crop up at any time during a project and it's important to have some contingency time allocated so that they don't cause significant disruption. This might vary depending on how critical the issue is – for example, if you're waiting for approval from a client then having a few extra days built in would be sensible, but if you're waiting for parts from suppliers then having a few weeks would be more appropriate .

#  How many photographs will be taken?

It’s hard to know exactly, but it’s likely that billions of photos will be taken in 2018. This number is continually on the rise as camera technology improves and smartphones become more ubiquitous. With everyone from grandparents to toddlers armed with cameras, there are photos being taken constantly and in ever-more creative ways.

While it’s impossible to know for certain how many photos will be taken this year, we can look at some data from years past to get an idea. In 2012, it was estimated that around 2 trillion photos would be taken over the course of the year. This number has only increased in recent years as camera technology becomes more accessible and photography becomes more popular.

So what factors are contributing to this trend? There are a few reasons why photos are being taken in greater numbers than ever before. First, cameras have become more portable and easier to use, making them available to more people. Additionally, social media has given people a venue to share their photos with friends and family all over the world. And finally, photography has become more affordable, so even budget-minded consumers can get in on the action.

All of these factors have contributed to the rise in photo taking, and there’s no sign that it will slow down anytime soon. As long as cameras continue to get smaller and easier to use, and social media remains a popular way to share information, the number of photographs taken every year will only continue to grow.

#  What is the goal of the project?

To provide a decentralized, censorship-resistant platform for publishing and storing data.

# What problem is the project trying to solve?

The project is designed to solve the problem of censorship and data loss by providing a platform that is immune to both.

# How does the project work?

The project relies on a distributed network of nodes to store and publish data. This network is designed to be resistant to censorship and data loss, making it a safe place for storing information.
